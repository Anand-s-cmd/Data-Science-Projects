# Data Science Projects
A collection of my Data Science projects in Jupyter notebooks. I mainly use Python, PostgreSQL and Scikit-learn to showcase the many different skills of a Data Scientist. I have a backlog of about 10 projects which will be continually released and uploaded here, check this space often!

## Capstone Project
*[Saddle Up! Machine Learning for Fun and Profit](https://github.com/matthewwilfred/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Saddle%20Up.ipynb)* is my Capstone Project showcasing the entire Data Science project workflow. The problem statement of the project: *Can you win against the bookies in horse race betting?*

I set out to answer this question for Hong Kong Jockey Club races, which brought in a whopping $107 billion HKD in turnover last year. Using a dataset of 6349 historical races from Kaggle, I built, evaluated and tested a variety of Machine Learning models to predict horse race wins, such as Logistic Regression and Random Forests for classification. Then I compared it to the bookies' odds to see if my prediction models could win money. Conclusion: beating the house is hard, but I uncovered some interesting insights in the world of horse racing.
