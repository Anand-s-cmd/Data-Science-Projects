# Data Science Projects
A collection of my Data Science projects in Jupyter notebooks. I mainly use Python, PostgreSQL and Scikit-learn to showcase the many different skills of a Data Scientist. I have a backlog of projects which will be continually released and uploaded here, check this space often!

## Capstone Project
*[Saddle Up! Machine Learning for Fun and Profit](https://github.com/matthewwilfred/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Capstone%20-%20Saddle%20Up.ipynb)* is my Capstone Project showcasing the entire Data Science project workflow. The problem statement of the project: *Can you win against the bookies in horse race betting?*

I set out to answer this question for Hong Kong Jockey Club races, which brought in a whopping $107 billion HKD in turnover last year. Using a dataset of 6349 historical races from Kaggle, I built, evaluated and tested a variety of Machine Learning models to predict horse race wins, such as Logistic Regression and Random Forests for classification. Then I compared it to the bookies' odds to see if my prediction models could win money. Conclusion: beating the house is hard, but I uncovered some interesting insights in the world of horse racing. You can also find my slide deck hosted [here](bit.ly/2iyFvHP).

## Kaggle Competition
*[Lung Cancer Detection - 2017 Kaggle Data Science Bowl](https://github.com/matthewwilfred/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Kaggle%20Competition%20Part%201%20-%20Image%20Preprocessing.ipynb")* is the first part of my Kaggle team's project to use Machine Learning as well as Deep Learning (more specifically Convolutional Neural Networks for image recognition), to design a classification model that helps better diagnose lung cancer from low dose CT scan images. This is the first part of a series of notebooks, which details our image preprocessing workflow.

*[3D Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/matthewwilfred/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Kaggle%20Competition%20Part%202%20-%203D%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Network.ipynb")* is the second part of our project. Here we use Keras with a Tensorflow backend to prototype a 3D ConvNet and verify that our image preprocessing workflow is valid by using the data from one patient. Read through for a discussion of the architecture of our network!
