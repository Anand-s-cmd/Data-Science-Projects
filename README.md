# Data Science Projects
A collection of Data Science projects in Jupyter notebooks. I mainly use Python, PostgreSQL and Scikit-learn to showcase the many different skills of a Data Scientist. I have a backlog of about 10 projects which will be continually released and uploaded here, check this space often!
